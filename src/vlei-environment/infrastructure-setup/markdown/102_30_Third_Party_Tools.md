# Third-Party Tools

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<b>ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE</b><hr>
Introduce third-party open-source projects that leverage the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) protocols, providing tools for managing identifiers and verifiable credentials.
</div>

## Open Source

The KERI and ACDC protocols provide a foundation for decentralized identity. A growing ecosystem of open-source tools is being built on these protocols, offering functionalities for developers and end-users. This section highlights a few notable third-party projects that integrate with KERI-based ecosystems.

### Signify Browser Extension

The signify-browser-extension is a browser-based wallet that integrates with web applications to manage KERI Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) and interact with KERI-based ecosystems. It allows users to approve operations (like signing data or consenting to credential exchanges) directly from their browser.

### KERI Foundation Wallet (SparÃ¡n)

SparÃ¡n offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing local KERI identifiers and cryptographic keys. It provides an alternative to the command-line interface (kli) for KERI operations. SparÃ¡n is built on top of the KERI library, a custom KERI agent runtime, and the Flet application framework.
