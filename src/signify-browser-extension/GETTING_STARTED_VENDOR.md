## Vendor customization guide

As a vendor the first thing required is to host a URL that returns JSON with the following structure and provide the link to the customers.

In this example we have a JSON hosted at following link:

Hosted JSON Link: https://www.npoint.io/docs/d59bd3ab0b31de863a20

API To fetch JSON: https://api.npoint.io/d59bd3ab0b31de863a20

Vendor would provide the API link to their customers.

Following is the JSON structure

```
{
  "title": "Provenant",
  "logo": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQG2_zXeSh-Qdw/company-logo_200_200/0/1663180132032/provenant_inc_logo?e=1715212800&v=beta&t=yINW7CaXVG50h3Ay7vu13OpY4mAu30qpijZwJAe5g-I",

### onboardingUrl
Hyperlink asociated to the text "Don't have a KERIA agent?"

### docsUrl

### supportUrl

### theme
this attribute is the essence of colors (and others e.g. spacing, fonts, etc in the FUTURE) customization. 
To keep it simplistic, the colors are designed to work in a two-tone fashion. 
- **bodyBg** and **bodyColor** have been used for base colors of screens e.g. sign in, sidebar, and content-script dialog. These should be contrasting and complimenting as these are used for background and text respectively.
- **primary** is primarily used for buttons
- **secondary** is used as a contrasting color to make it distinct from **bodyBg**. It is used for the listings and modal background.
- **cardColor** and **cardBg** are used for the list items e.g. identifier card or credential card.
- **heading**, **text**, and **subtext** have been used for label and value pairs on each listing item.
